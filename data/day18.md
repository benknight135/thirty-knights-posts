### Exploring Genoa

On my way towards the south of France I have one last taste of Italy in visiting Genoa. After a long train ride from Bologna I checked into the hostel and dropped my stuff and headed out to explore. I am leaving early in the morning tomorrow so this evening will be my only opportunity to take in as much as I can.

The landscape of the city is absolutely fascinating. It is amazing how the geometry of the land has clearly impacted how things where built. The streets sit on so many different levels, at times the tops of large buildings are eye level with the next street. It also includes many thin winding streets with shops on both sides towering over. 

I walked from the hostel through the city to the river where I was surprised to find a dry river and grazing on the riverbed were wild boar.
