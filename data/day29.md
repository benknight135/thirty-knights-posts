### Lunch by the Louvre

After a relaxing morning I headed towards the Louvre. When I arrived at the Louvre it was around lunch time so I found a restaurant close by and had a glass of wine and delicious burger.

### Visiting the Louvre

After lunch I headed to the Louvre. The building is absolutely beautiful architecturally. Each layer of history is visible as you head down. The medieval stone walls excavated at the bottom. It would be easy to spend a long time here with the huge hallways and many stairs to get intentionally lost inside of. The art that fills each room is magnificent, I especially like marble sculptures that depict draping cloth and there are certainly plenty of them in all shapes and sizes at the Louvre. I of course visited the Mona Lisa though Iâ€™ve never particularly been drawn to the painting and much more enjoyed many of the countless other paintings all over. 

Also while I was there, there was an art show going on for artists to sell their pieces. I absolutely loved walking around and seeing the scope of variation possible in art and the creativity that is alive and well.
