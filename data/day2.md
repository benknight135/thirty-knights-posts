### Sunday market breakfast

The day started with a very short walk to the local Sunday market for breakfast. This is the Old Lille market and happens every Sunday. I got myself a croissant, actually using my very small knowledge of the French language for the first time, which went well with only a little stumbling over my own tongue.

### Notre Dammmmme

With a bit of fuel in me, I headed off in the direction of the bells I heard last night. I found my way to Notre Dame de la Treille. This is a beautiful Cathedral with a mix of old and new architecture. A modern front with a very old everything else. After marvelling at the exterior I ventured inside but, as it was Sunday and there was a service going on, I just peaked my head in and then left so as not to intrude.

I went off to explore the surrounding streets, which included the nearby Passage des Arts, petting a cute cat that was out for a walk, and getting myself a tarte de la rhubarb. I also realised last night that I managed to forget my toothbrush and toothpaste so I popped to the local supermarket to stock up.

### Musée

Today I wanted to explore the best  museums that Lille had to offer so I headed first for the Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille. This is a famously large collection of Art which could be taken in for hours. 

Very close by is the Musée d’Histoire Naturelle de Lille. This is a small site but was a wonder to walk around. It is a little creepy as they have a huge amount of taxidermy animals, especially birds, from huge vultures to tiny blue tits. Hanging from the ceiling are the bones of a whale. Something that kept me captivated for a good while was a live ant exhibit where the process of collecting food from a plant shown through glass. This had clear tubes that connected a container with a leafy plant to the ant colony so you could see them going out to find the plant and bringing the leaves on their backs all the way back down a spiralling route assault course that had been built for them. They also had a cool collection of animal abnormalities for example birds with extra legs or snakes with extra heads.

### Il pleut des cordes

After a lunch by the river, watching children fail to steer hire boats to their parents dismay, the heavens opened and I sheltered under an archway nearby. During this time I was informed of the French saying for heavy rain “Il pleut des cordes” meaning “It’s raining ropes”. This then sent me researching into the etymology of the English “raining cats and dogs”. Which is actually so old that no one really knows where it comes from. Though some think it is from rains being so heavy they dislodge animals from the drainage system.

The rains then cleared up and so I continued to explore the city. Soon stumbling across an interesting parade with lots of people dressed in togas marching down the street singing and chanting. I sent a video of the proceedings around for assistance in translating but it was mostly Oh ay oh which doesn’t mean much of anything. Anyways, looked like some fun!

### Carbonnade flamande

For dinner I headed down to Les Compagnons de la Grappe which is situated in a small side alley near the Grand Place. I was looking for somewhere that served Carbonnade flamande; a famous dish in the north of France. This is similar to a beef bourguignon but instead of wine the beef is slow cooked in beer. This gives it a really deep, dark flavour. I am normally vegetarian, however while travelling I made the decision to allow myself to eat anything and everything for exactly this kind of reason. To really experience a place is to experience the food.
