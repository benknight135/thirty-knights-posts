### To Verona

Today I am on my way to Venice, taking a day trip to Verona on the way. My feet are still sore from the long walks of the past few days so I will decide how much exploring to do in Verona once I arrive.

### Verona flying visit

After a little bit of lunch and some exploring of Ponte Scaligero Ponte di Castelvecchio and the surrounding area I quickly got very exhausted. I have been doing a lot of walking over the last few days and it’s finally taking its toll. I had looked up a few places to explore around Verona but I didn’t feel much like walking to them without knowing they would be worth it. I decided to conserve my energy for Venice tomorrow and head back to the station. I did on my way make sure to walk past the famous arena and couple of additional buildings in Città Antica which were very beautiful.

### Heavenly hostel

Getting to this hostel was absolutely the best idea. It is situated 3 minutes from the station has super fast WiFi and comfy beds and very friendly staff. Also there are things going on the bar every night, including a Karaoke night on Mondays so I’m definitely going to try that out tomorrow. Also very glad the hostel has laundry facilities as I was on my last pair of socks!

I finished the day eating out at a restaurant around the corner that was recommended by one of the people in my dorm. I had a spaghetti carbonara which just hit the right spot.
