### Meeting the host

Today was a day of travel to get me to Lescar. This first took me Pau as this is closest city to Lescar with an accessible train line. My aim will be to hike from Lescar into the Pyrenees.
I had an Airbnb booked in Lescar and the host was kind enough to give me a lift to his house, however this did mean about an hour walk to a place that would be convenient. I arrived at the agreed spot half an hour early which gave me some good time to practice some possible French I might need. This was important as the host had informed me that they only spoke French and did not know any English. I learnt a couple of phrases that I would be useful like confirming the hosts name and a few car related words like the boot for the initial interaction. 
A little while later I spotted him coming out of his car. We clocked each other and greeted and I was able to communicate asking to put my big bag in the boot. I was very happy to actually be able to put what I had practiced into use. We got in the car and he drove towards his house in Lescar. Along the way we began a few introductions and he explained about his family living near by. He talked about being retired and divorced and his age and such. It was so rewarding to actually be able to get to piece together the small amount of French that I knew and actually get a pretty detailed picture of him. This of course went both ways as he asked about my age and my job and why and where I was travelling. Explaining my job did take quite a bit of google translate to find the words close enough to what I do but thatâ€™s part of the fun! 
It may seem a little silly to list out what we spoke about but I feel it gives a good impression on the amount of information that was able to be communicated between us with a very limited knowledge of French on my side. I way actually very proud of the interaction and while I do take some part of that for learning what I could before this trip, I do think that he was such a kind and patient person and was very happy for me to make lots of mistakes and put the effort in to want to connect with me. I think so very highly of him and thank him dearly.

We continued chatting over coffee when we arrived at his home and I showed him some images of the places I had been on this trip so far. It was such a lovely experience.

I asked for some recommendations for places to eat and he directed me to where the near by restaurants were where I had a very tasty dish that was a collection of their best dishes in small portions which included lots of cheesy filled plates which were delicious. After retuning to the house I knew I had my hike tomorrow so I called an early night and headed to bed.
