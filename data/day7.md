# Day 7: ‘Como’ on Eileen

### Shocking

As Milan and the surrounding area is currently in a minor thunderstorm, I gave myself most of the morning for things to calm down a little. By 10am, the major rains had stopped so I headed out for Como. There was still a little drizzle so when I arrived I looked for something that I could do indoors and luckily quickly found, the Museum of Volta (the irony of Volta after a thunderstorm was not lost on me). This Museum went through the history of the discovery of electricity to the invention of the battery. With real inventions from each stage along the way. It was absolutely fascinating to see the progress of what now seems so commonplace. I read one sign that talked about how people used to have electricity parties where they would invite a scientist over and each of the guests would get electrocuted (non fatally).

### Hiking Lake Como

After the rain cleared up I marched on to make the most of the clear skies. The Volta museum was right on the shore of Lake Como so I continued on through the villages lining the lakeside. It was an absolutely stunning lake with mountains on all sides wearing capes of mist that shrouded their peaks. I kept close to the shore and walked and walked as far as I could manage. Finding so many brilliant spots to see the lake from a new angle. Eventually I ran out of pavement and so, after walking for nearly 2 hours, I headed back.

### A new route back to base

On the way heading back to Milan I found there was a station that was much closer to the hostel than Milan Central called Milan Cadorna. This took about the same train travel time but cut down the walk back to the hostel to just 15 mins. This was much appreciated after a long walk. The dramatic change in environment between the mountains and lakes to the centre of Milan is quite intense so anything to reduce the time on the busy streets is much appreciated.
