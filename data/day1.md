### Packed up and ready to go!

This blog is going to follow my journey travelling across France and Italy (and a little Switzerland) via train over the period of a month.

A little backstory, I had originally planned on taking a holiday to somewhere in Italy as I had never been before. But as fate would have it, when I was researching the potential holiday earlier in the year, it happened to be the anniversary of inter rail. As part of this they were doing a 50% off promotion for most of the tickets. Bringing the global pass from nearly £400-£500 to £216. This meant that for the price of a holiday in Italy I could travel around anywhere in Europe for a whole month!

FYI in case someone happens upon this blog thinking of doing a similar trip I will include all the places I stay and the interesting things I get up to (links and prices where possible). I am keeping track of my spending during the trip and will likely include a full breakdown at the end of all the final costs at the end.

### Goodbye Brighton

First leg is from Brighton to London to catch the Eurostar. I took a moment to marvel at the Brighton train station for a final time before I leave. I really love this city so much and I have so many lovely people around me. I’m a little scared to be leaving my safety net, but that doesn’t stop me being very excited for what is to come.

### Next stop Lille!

FYI although the inter rail train ticket does cover loads of trains all over Europe, some require a reservation fee. The only journeys that require this for the trip that I have planned are between London and Lille at the start of the trip, and Paris and London at the end. These required a €32 reservation fee along side the inter rail pass.

### Bienvenue à Lille

The Eurostar is a very comfy ride (other than when your ears pop a little) as well as a speedy one. My train left at 13:01 (BST) and arrived at 15:25 (CET). With the time zone change that’s about and 1hour and a half.

### The People Hostel

After a short wander around the city I made my way down to my hostel. I am staying in The People, a hostel just a 30min walk from the station. I will be staying here for two nights. This gives me a full day to explore Lille tomorrow and plenty of time to rest before moving on as I know the next train journey is going to be a long one. Soon after I arrived the bells from the Cathedral near by started ringing beautifully. This is the Notre Dame de la Treille Cathedral. I will certainly go for a proper look around tomorrow.

The hostel is clean and friendly. I am staying in a 4 bed dorm, for which I paid £38.62 for two nights (£19.31 per night).

### Night stroll in Lille

Spent the evening wondering around the cobbled streets and exploring the city. Boy do I love travelling on my own! It was so much fun to be able to wonder off aimlessly in each and every direction as each and every thing caught my eye. Lille is full of so much amazing old architecture. I found my way down to the river where there are lots of restaurants along the banks and even a few restaurant boats that looked gorgeous with their light reflecting off the water.
