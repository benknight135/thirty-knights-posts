### Antibes

Today I will be travelling to Nimes, a city just outside of Montpellier. But on the way, after a recommendation from a friend, I stopped off for a morning in Antibes. This beautiful town on the coast is host to a fort, lovely beaches and huge super-yacht. I started the day walking around the fort. Which also provided stunning views of the town and seafront. Then walked down a secluded sandy beach near the docks. The sea was remarkably clear and the sun shined brightly so I had a little dip in the water and some time relaxing with the waves. Once I had dried off I headed towards the town centre and had, for the first time, beef tartare. It was very strange to get used to eating raw beef. I had to walk myself into it by having it first with some bread like a pâté before I could eat it on its own. But once my head got out of the way it was rather nice. Whilst having lunch I was sat in such a beautiful setting with a glass of wine in my hand, the sea air, and a very talented accordion musician playing wonderful music to round out the experience.

### Charcuterie

After a lovey sunny beach day I arrived in Nimes to a sudden burst of rain! I checked into the hostel then headed out in search of dinner (now equipped with a raincoat). Walking around the city centre everything looked very quiet. There were a few wine bars and the odd restaurant but looks like the rain kept everyone away. I ended up at a restaurant where I ordered a charcuterie of meats and peppers with a glass of wine.
