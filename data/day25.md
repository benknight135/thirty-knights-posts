### Forests

Today was a much longer hike from Aubertin to Oloron. The experienced hikers route would have gone from Lescar to Oloron in one day and consisted of just over 30km. As I am new to this I chose the split this up into stopping at Aubertin which created a 10km yesterday and a 20km today. At this point however I was well into the hills by the Pyrenees so the walk was much more pleasant. After passing lots of vineyards, the majority of the walk took me through beautiful forests. There were lots of up and down hills but the stunning surroundings were a perfect motivator. I spotted lots of really interesting mushrooms along the route included one that looked like fried eggs and some very large trees that had recently fallen over. There was even one instance of a tree that had clearly taken out the other tree next to it in the process of falling leaving a dramatic scene of splinters. I also spotted a very large puddle that looked like a giant footprint.

### Lunch overlooking the mountains

I stopped off for lunch in small town called Estialescq which had an area with a picnic bench that provided lovely views of the mountains and was accompanied by a large beautiful tree.

### Arriving in Oloron

I arrived in Oloron after many hours of walking. I would definitely say that’s that’s the most challenging walk I’ve ever done and I’ve certainly built up some mental resilience that I didn’t know I was capable of. 
It was a little disheartening that the first sign I saw as I entered Oloron was for McDonalds but the important thing was that I had made it.

I had picked up a stick on the first day of walking that was laying next to one of the first benches along Arles Way and it was certainly a valued member of the team. I have quite a painful blister on the bottom of my left foot which really started to give resistance from around lunchtime so this afternoon was a tricky hike and the stick was essential. 

As Oloron is a large built up town I was able to restock my supplies and have a decent meal to rejuvenate. 

I checked into the Airbnb that was hosted by an older lady that didn’t want to give me much interaction other than to show me my room and give me to WiFi details. Which is fair enough, and was actually just what I needed as I just wanted to crash out in bed and relax.
