### Eiffel Tower

I arrived in Paris around mid day and took an important detour to my hostel to the Eiffel Tower. After taking the required photo of me pointing at the tower I had much lunch in the grass at the base of the tower. Amusing over each person doing variations of the Eiffel Tower point.
