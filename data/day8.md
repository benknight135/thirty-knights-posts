### Ready for more Lake Como

I had a really lovely time at Lake Como yesterday but felt like I didn’t full do it justice with the weather being so bad. Today the weather forecast looked absolutely wonderful so I decided to give it another go. Also my original plan was to spend the day touring Milan and my experience of Milan so far has put that as very low priority on my list. I feel it’s just too busy and not built for people. Would much rather be climbing a mountain, and so that’s what I decided to do! On the way to the station I did make sure to try and pass a couple of the old architectural sites in Milan so as not to completely miss them. Which I was glad to have done as they were very beautiful.

### Soak up in preparation

When I arrived in Como it was close to lunch time so I found a lovely restaurant very close to the waters’ edge that served cocktails and pizza. Exactly what is needed before a hike. It was such a beautiful atmosphere, being able to look out at Lake Como, with tasty food. To add to the splendour, a few minutes later, a saxophonist started playing! Absolutely stunning. I ordered a Mojito and a Pizza and soaked up all that was before me. After I finished my meal a little bird came and perched next to my table, adding just a little more magic. Sitting in that experience was actually my number two of all the things to happen on the trip so far.

### Secret garden

Fuelled up and ready to go I set off to climb. I had found a rough route the night before that took me through the winding streets up to Cernobbio and a little beyond. At about the half way point I stumbled upon a beautiful secret garden, hidden away in a little side street. This garden clearly had a lot of care and attention. There were ponds and wooden bridges and little cards next to each of the plants with their Latin name. After a little explore, it was the perfect place to have a short break and watch the lizards warm themselves in the sun.

### The clearing

A little later I made it through to Cernobbio, and after a small trek into a wooded area the clearing opened up into a breathtaking view. This looked out over Lake Como and allowed for a 180 degree viewing of the surrounding mountains to see far and wide. From time to time a seaplane would take off from Como on the far right and fly past. Landing in a town on the far left out of view. I looked at this scene for a long time to take in a much as I possibly could.

### New friends, feline and human

On the way back along the same route, I was rounding a corner and laid my eyes on a beautiful cat. A few seconds later I realised this cat was sitting on a nice German man who was close to finishing a hike of his own. After plenty of petting the cat, we both headed back to Como together. It was nice to share the journey and talk through each of our trips and plans. Once we reached the bottom and got to the centre of Como we parted ways as friends and continued each to write our own next stories.
