### Change of plans

Originally my plan was to go to Rome for the next few days however due to my new mindset of having much better times outside of cities, and cost of hostels I started looking for alternatives yesterday. I very quickly decided to go to Pompeii. It would be absolutely wonderful to spend some time there, so that is where I am headed today! I was going to get the slow 8 hour train to Naples however for €12 I could get there in 4 hours so opted for that option instead. This will mean I’m much more refreshed when I get there and that I can explore a little bit when I arrive.

### To Pompeii

It was such an amazing trip, rolling towards Naples and seeing the awe inspiring Vesuvius coming into view. The train line takes you alongside so you get to have a really good look at it for a long time as you get closer to the centre of Naples. 
From here it is a quick bus hop to Pompei where my hostel is located.

### BEST pizza of my entire LIFE

There is a Pizzeria in Naples that was highly recommended by my friends and it would appear the world as a whole. This is L’Antica Pizzeria da Michele. Located in the centre of Naples I just had to check it out!
They are so popular that they have a ticket system for a table like a deli. There was only about a 20 minute wait for a table which is not too bad at all. Luckily they have an option for indecisive people which is split 50/50 Margarita and Marinara. OMG it is incredible. The dough is soft but crispy from the occasional bit of char. The sauce is perfectly sweet and it all leaves an amazing garlicy after taste. Wow.
