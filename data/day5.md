### Change of plans

This is the magic of inter railing. Being able to be wildly spontaneous. I found out last night that the beloved Myizaki animated film Howl’s Moving Castle was based on the French city of Colmar. I am just two hours from this city right now and it’s in the same direction I was going to be heading on the way to Bern. So today I will be taking an impromptu trip to Colmar!

### New friends

After a little exploring I started chatting to a lovely German couple who were in Colmar on holiday and they invited me to join them for lunch. We went to a nice restaurant right next to the Église des Dominicains church. The wife was a wonderfully chatty person who then immediately also got talking to the tables around us, meaning that I also got to meet a very friendly Dutch couple. The food was an incredibly filling meat and potatoes dish which was just perfect to get me through needing to buy much more food when I get to the expensive Bern this evening.

### Meeting Howl’s Castle

Bidding a farewell to the German couple I went in search of the actual house that one of the iterations of Howl’s Castle is based on. The real name of this place is Maison Pfister, located near Collégiale St-Martin church. It is a gorgeous house with turrets and a balcony. I can see why this would inspire Miyazaki to design the changeable wacky house in the film. 

Another claim to fame for Colmar is that the sculpture of the Statue of Liberty, Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, was born in Colmar. There is a museum dedicated to his work and includes some of the early small scale models of the statue and the history leading up to its creation. Was a very interesting visit!

### Bern baby Bern

After absorbing all I possibly could from Colmar in a flying visit, I headed off to the station in the direction of Bern. It was such a wonderful idea to stop off at Colmar rather than just getting a train to Bern as was originally planned. I am so grateful for the flexibility of traveling this way and the unexpected success that today has been.
