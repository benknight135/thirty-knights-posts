### Nice from above

The day started with a 3 hour train journey crossing the Italy/France border along to the south of France. Once I arrived it was early afternoon so I checked into my hostel and headed off to explore. I first headed for Mont Boron. This was a long walk but is the highest point in Nice and gave wonderful views of the city.

### Sunset in Nice

I saw that the sun was starting to set so walked towards another magical high spot in Nice, Castle Hill. This used to be a defensive fort in the city and provides amazing views all around. Once I got to the top I also discovered that there was a beautiful waterfall and a great viewing platform. The perfect place to watch the sunset over the city.

### 3 course meal

From the top of the hill I spotted a street with lots of restaurants. I walked down towards them and found a lovely restaurant where I tried lots of lovely French cuisine. First I had the famous Nicois Salade, which consisted of olives, salad leaves, tuna, capers, egg and tomato. For the main I had rabbit with dauphinoise potatoes. Then a crème brûlée for dessert that was laid out across a plate which meant it had really large surface area for a big crispy crystallised top. Delicious.
