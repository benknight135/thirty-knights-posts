### Journey through the mountains

With the success of yesterdays trip to Colmar, I decided to once again break up what would be a long train ride into a couple of smaller journeys with a day visit in between. Today, as I was heading to Milan, the train would go over the mountains so I broke this into a stop at Brig and a stop a Domodosola.  

The train ride from Bern to Brig was incredibly beautiful, swaying through the valleys beneath the mountains. Then just before arriving in Brig, there was a 15-20mins section completely in the dark as we hurtle through a long tunnel through the mountainside, making my ears pop many times as the pressure changed.

### Soul nourishing hike

After seeing the beautiful rolling hills from the train window, I had to go and explore them for myself. I set off in the direction of the best hill I saw. I came across a wonderful public hiking route that started at a stunning waterfall then meandered up the hillside. Very steep in parts and a large effort with my heavy bag on my back but absolutely 100% worth it. I eventually reached a clearing which gave views from high above Brig as well as stunning mountains and cliff faces in all directions. I had a genuinely soul nourishing experience taking in all that was before me. 

I had my lunch staring out across the hills, the view and the effort to get there making it taste ever so sweeter. Then headed all the way back down. At the bottom, where the waterfall was, there was a cave with a small river running through it. I jumped from rock to rock and explored the inside of the cave that opened up again at the other end. There was a large rock here that was perfectly situated for me to take off my shoes and socks and stick my feet in the cooling water as I calmed myself with the babbling brook.

### Haul my weary feet to Milan

All in all the hike took around 2 hours from start the finish. And by the time I had reached the station I was exhausted. I had originally planned to also spend some time in Domodossola. However, once I arrived there, I had no WiFi and no signal and my feet hurt so I decided against it and headed straight for Milan. Because of this change of plan, and not having a way to look up trains, I ended up on a train that required a reservation fee of €20. But at that point I would have paid anything to get to Milan and a bed quickly.

### Battle to rest

I hadn’t quite appreciated how far away the hostel was from the station. It took nearly 50mins to walk there. I could have taken public transport or a taxi but doing that in a city I am completely unfamiliar with and in a language I don’t know at all was a very scary concept to me! I battled my through the busy city and eventually made it to the New Generation hostel. And most importantly a shower and a bed. Yet with all the exhaustion, I would do it all again, for that mountain view.
