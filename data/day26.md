### New plan

I had originally planned to hike from Oloron out to Sarrance or one of the towns a little further on. However, after reviewing the route and finding that it was mostly tarmac roads to Sarrance, I decided to make some adjustments. The idea behind the specific section of the Arles Way I was hiking was that along side it ran a railway line from Pau to Oloron and on to Bedous in the Pyrenees where it terminated. The hike route followed this railway line quite closely so the idea was the hike from Oloron and then when I’d had enough get the train back at the closest station to Pau and onto Bordeaux where I had a hostel booked and could relax. The idea of walking for hours on tarmac roads did not sound like any fun so I chose to get the train to Sarrance and then hike the interesting section to Bedous which would take be through valleys deep in the mountains at a length of around 10km.

### Walking riverside

The train to Sarrance was a single carriage that only ran 4 times a day between Pau and Bedous. Luckily it had lovely large windows that allowed me to view the huge Pyrenees mountains come into view and then we dip into a valley and take a winding route between two large mountains. I got off and instantly saw the sign posts for the Arles Way route which within minutes had me on a dirt path right alongside the river. Exactly where I wanted to be.

The hike was beautiful. The trail lead me along the banks of the river with its crystal clear waters. The route took me up and down the mountain so at times the river got very small and the path scarily thin but in each peak this gave me amazing views downstream seeing the stacks of mountains in the distance. This was exactly the experience I was hoping to find in walking the Pyrenees.

### Arrive in Bedous

As I had left Oloron quite early in the morning I arrived in Bedous around midday. I knew that there were trains at 4pm and 7pm to get me back to Pau and onwards so I had a little time to explore the town. The town is situated in a valley that is surrounded on all sides by mountains. It is incredible.

### Surprising change of plans

For safety I headed down to the train station so I knew where it was when I needed it later and was surprised to find that there were no trains listed as running for the rest of the day. This was strange as I had checked the day before and knew there should be two trains but I could only see trains for the tomorrow. I check my train app and it confirms for me that, yes, both the trains I could have got back have been cancelled. After a bit of searching I find out that there are rail strikes going on. So I now have no way back. This train line is the only public transport in the area and there are no taxi services running in this town. I am endlessly grateful to discover that there are a couple of Airbnb’s available and am able to quickly reserve a room for the night. This does mean I will be paying for a hostel night in Bordeaux that I won’t be there for I phone up the hostel to let them know and while I can’t get any refunds on it they at least know I won’t be there to check in and avoid any fees. I am not able to check into the Airbnb until 5pm so I now have a few hours extra in Bedous. While I am tired and me feet hurt a lot I want to make the most of the stunning surroundings so I see that the official Arles Way passes by a hill a little further past Bedous so I had out to climb that hill.

### Climbing Le Poey

The hill is about an hours hike from Bedous and passes through a few small farm villages before the hill starts to tower in front. I should clarify, when I say hill, this is hundreds of meters high and towers in the centre of the valley. Placed on the top of this hill is a large cross that can be clearly seen from the bottom. I can see why the Arles Way passes this hill, and although the route goes around the edge, as I’m sure many have also done before me, I started to climb to get to that cross.

The climb is a winding path that zig zags along the side of the hill and then finishes with a steep straight line towards the peak. The climb took 20-30 minutes to get to the top. The feeling of accomplishment and joy on placing my hand on the base of that cross was incredible.

### At the top of Le Poey

At the top there is a small flat area to stand and look out. The location of this hill places it in the centre of a valley with mountains in every direction. The height of the hill also allows for views down into the valley and the towns below. Words cannot describe the beautiful of the scene at the top of that hill. I’m not going to forget it anytime soon.
