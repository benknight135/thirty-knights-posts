### Bologna flying visit

Along the way from Venice to Florence my train was delayed by 30 minutes which meant missing the changer over in Bologna. Luckily this was timed just perfectly for lunch. I found a pizzeria near the station serving rollo, a rolled pizza slice with a base that tasted like a cross between a crepe and a thin pizza. Will have to look up a recipe when I am back in England to see if I recreated it as it was delicious! 

After a bite to eat I had a small explore of the sites near the station such as Porta Galliera and a lovely park (Parco della Montagnola) but couldn’t wonder too far as my next train was only an hour away. But this did allow me some time to think about what I would like to do when I am here properly in a few days. (Potentially a food tour!).

### Tasty stomach sandwich

I arrived in the Florence hostel and found that it had a rooftop pool! A newly made friend in my dorm said it was too cold when I arrived as they had just got out but will give it a go during the day tomorrow. I was to happy to immediately get to know all of the other people in this 4 bed dorm, everyone was very friendly and happy to share their journeys. After chatting for a little bit I headed out in search of dinner. Someone recommended I try a Florentine speciality known as Lampredotto. This is a sandwich with meat made from the forth stomach of a cow. They have lots of food carts serving this dish all over Florence but the one I went to was incredibly friendly and had stools and seating around the cart. The sandwich was absolutely delicious, I highly recommend it! The name comes from the Italian word for eels and you can tell why by the texture however the flavour is incredible. I don’t think I’m selling it very well here but I can promise it was good!
