### Inside the castle

I intentionally did not set an alarm for this morning and naturally woke up around 10am feeling very rested. I got ready and then headed into the city towards Carcassonne Castle. When getting close to the castle there is an old stone bridge that takes you across the canal. It provides beautiful views of the whole castle with its many spires and large variation of rooftops. Inside the castle there are many tourist shops where you can buy swords and crossbows and such to pretend to be a knight. There is also couple of museums all about the inquisition that host a large collection of displays on all the many gruesome ways people where tortured.

### Lunch in the castle

Along side all the shops, there are also many restaurants. I managed to find an absolutely wonderful place called L’Ecu d’Or. The waiter was incredibly friendly and the food was delicious. I starting with a brie, honey, and walnut salad. Followed by a stunning Carcassonne pork and Toulouse sausage cassoulet. It was very peppery and full of deep flavour. Accompanied, of course, by a glass of wine.

### Walking the walls

After lunch I went into the castle within the castle. This is the old part of the castle that originally stood. Inside this area is where you can access to walls of the castle. This took me all over the outer rim with amazing views all around. It was a beautiful clear day so on one side you could even see the Pyrenees towards the Spanish border.
