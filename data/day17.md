### Small train worries

I rush to the station having reserved a train to Bologna and only 20mins to get there and google maps saying it will be a 28 minute walk. I have long legs and willing to run in small bursts so get there in 15 minutes. I arrive at the station and there is a train heading to Lecco leaving at the right time but with no indication as the the other stops so I ask the ticket staff standing at the side of the train and show him that I am heading for Bologna Centrale. He says no itâ€™s not this train, then just as the train is pulling away the overhead board updates to show it was in fact this train. I put it down to translation issues between us and get a ticket for the next train to Bologna from the machine and find that the reservation fee online is actually more than the price of a ticket at the station. So that might be something to double check in future. Anyway, I am now on my way to Bologna for a day of food that will push away any small stresses of the morning.
