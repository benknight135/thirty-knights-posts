### Aranchina

I took a train over the Bologna and started my day with a ragu aranchina at the same place that served me the rollo pizza a few days earlier, Pizza Leggera Gourmet which is right next to the train station. I ate this sitting in a lovely  park with a fountain with a giant turtle sculpture.

### Coffee break

Next I headed over to the Basilica di San Petronio near the center of Bologna. I found a coffee shop with a fantastic view of the Basilica while I scoped out the best place for lunch online.

### Tortellini

Close to the square that hosts the Basilica is a restaurant named 051 Osteria. Here I enjoyed a creamy tortellini with ham and Parmesan. Accompanied by a glass of wine.

### Site seeing

I could absolute eat and drink all day in a place as wonderful as this but to make sure I was saving room I took a short break to do some site seeing. 

I walked down to the Teatro Anatomico a great hall which was used to train Physicians in the 16th century. It was bombed in 1944 but the original wood was recovered from the ruins and the theatre rebuilt to match the original shortly after. This had a large stone operating table at the centre of the room where the lecturer would teach. And there is rows on wooden benches all around. On the walls and the ceiling are stunning sculptures. One of which is a cherub holds a femur outstretched in its hand.

### Tigelle

A famous Bologna lunchtime snack is tigelle. This is a round thin bread that is usually filled with cold meats and cheese. I ordered a tigelle with prosciutto ham and ricotta cheese and it was absolutely delicious. It was beautifully light with delicious local ingredients.

### Talented baristas

As it was a little early for dinner I looked around for somewhere for a coffee break. Highly recommend was a place named Terzi. This artisanal coffee shop was amazing. The baristas were clearly incredibly passionate about making amazing coffee. I first had a pistachio cremeno, which had pistachio and chocolate and the bottom, beautifully rich coffee, and sweet whipped cream with a sprinkle of pistachios on top. After such a success I asked for a recommendation on which roast for an expresso and they talked me through their 5 specially chosen coffees that ranged from bitter with high caffeine to sweet and Lowe caffeine. I have a sweet tooth so opted for a sweet Indian roast. They serve the expresso at the counter with a small shot glass of water to cleanse the pallet. The expresso was so full of flavour and I absolutely stunned. I do not drink coffee very often but clearly that because Iâ€™ve not been having the right coffee. I cannot recommend Terzi enough.

### Ravioli

To finish the day I headed to Sfoglia Rina a pasta shop that focuses on local high quality ingredients and calls itself a pasta laboratory for the consistent innovation with pasta. This has an attached restaurant which of course means the absolute freshest pasta. I ordered ravioli stuffed with ricotta and spinach in a balsamic vinegar sauce topped with raspberry. I was blown away. Every element worked perfectly with each other. On the menu they also had an apple and sausage pasta dish so I am definitely inspired to try out paring fruits with pasta in my own pasta back home. Along side the pasta I had a lovely glass of red wine. 

As I was positioned on a large communal table in the centre of the restaurant I also had the pleasure of talking to a wonderful Canadian who was also holidaying in Bologna. So the delicious food was joined by great conversation and new friends.
