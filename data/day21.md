### Lay of the land

Arriving in Carcassonne I first spent some time wondering around the beautiful old streets of the city and getting a lay of the land. This city is absolutely full of medieval architecture. I stopped for a glass of wine in a square in the centre of the city that had a large fountain and enjoyed watching the world go by.

### Walking the canal

A little while later I headed to my Airbnb. This included a magical walk along the canal out from the city. Walking around the final bend I spotted the bright yellow building and could barely believe how lovely it looked.

### Sleeping in nature

But the joy was yet to increase for it is not this building I will be staying in for the next to nights. I will be staying in a wonderful wooden hut, surrounded by nature!

There are 4 huts in the gardens behind the canal side cafe. Strung up with fairy lights and with a lovely picnic bench under them. It was such a lovely evening listening to the birds say goodnight to the sun and drift off to sleep myself shortly after.
