### Crossing borders at speed

Today I will be travelling from Lille to Metz. This journey will take me through the border for both Brussels and Luxembourg before crossing back over into France towards Metz. All in all, this will take 7 hours and 4 trains. It would have been possible to take a more direct route via Paris however this would have required an additional reservation fee and I am doing my best in this trip to avoid that where possible. Also I’d like to reserve seeing Paris till the end of my trip as that will be a signal that my trip is coming to a close. Can’t be spoiling the fun early!

I checked out of my hostel around 8:00 and walked down to Lille Flandres station, grabbing myself a croissant on the way. Then it was a quick hop to Mouscron, followed by an hour and a half across to Brussels. I sadly only got to see a very grey industrial look at Brussels as I had less than a 20min transfer time before heading to Luxembourg.

### Forests through the window

The journey from Brussels to Luxembourg is a very beautiful one, making its way through miles and miles of thick forests near Parc naturel régional des Ardennes. The train travels peacefully through the countryside as the odd town pokes its way through the trees with an occasional church steeple in a valley clearing.

### Tower block Airbnb

I arrived in Metz around 4pm and quickly made my way to the Airbnb I had booked. It had been very difficult to find a hostel in Metz so I had reverted to an Airbnb that was a 10min walk from the station to make things easy. This Airbnb was a spare room in a tower block which was in the process of having renovations. The broken doors and spare material all over the place made it a bit of an unnerving entrance but once inside the flat, everything was lovely and the host was friendly.

### Quiche Lorraine

After settling in I headed out in search of dinner. Being as Metz is just down the road from Lorraine I was determined to find somewhere that served Quiche Lorraine. It was raining pretty heavily and was still fairly early in the evening so many places were shut but I ended up finding a lovely place in an area near the centre of Metz with lots of restaurants called Place Saint-Jacques. I ordered a Quiche Lorraine as well as a mojito. Got to try and bring the sun when il plue des cordes. The quiche was very light and creamy with a filo pastry crust so while it was a very large size slice, the portion was just right.
