### Queue

The day started with a continental breakfast at the hostel after which I headed out towards the Venetian island. I had intended to buy the ticket to St Lucia online rather than use the kiosk machines but couldn’t get on WiFi when I got to the station so had to wait in 30 minute queue to get to the machine. But eventually got the ticket and got on the quick hop to the island.

### Seafood pasta

The streets of Venice were so very busy and full of tourists that at first it wasn’t a pleasant experience. But after exploring out to less traversed alleys for some quiet, everything got much more pleasant. After I recovered, I headed back down to the waters edge to find a lovely restaurant where I sipped on a piñata colada and had a very tasty seafood spaghetti.

### Opera

After lunch I continued to explore Venice and eventually found my way to a courtyard in front of a grand building where an opera singer was projecting incredible sounds. I stayed here a while taking in the soothing sounds.

### Leonardo da Vinci

I finished the day at the Leonardo da Vinci museum that had many replicas of da Vinci’s inventions and interactive recreations of the mechanics. It included details on his progress learning mechanical engineering and the machines that it inspired as well as the interconnection between biological and mechanical studies.

### Karaoke

Each night at the hostel bar they half events and on Monday nights they put on Karaoke! Rather backing music they have a live musician that plays the songs with you. It was so much fun to hear so many people sing their hearts out to “I want it that way” and “Sweet Caroline”. There were also a couple of surprising good singers such as an Italian guy that sounded just like Ed Sheeran! It was a great fun atmosphere.
