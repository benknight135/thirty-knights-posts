### Reaching the start

Today is the first day of hiking the Pyrenees. I left from Lescar heading for Aubertin, a small town that makes a good half way point towards Oloron and is around 10km. The first exciting step was getting out of Lescar and reaching the first sign for the Voie dâ€™Arles also known as Arles Way on the Camino de Santiago.

### Arriving in Aubertin

The hike was much more road biased than I would I ideally have liked however this first walk was to get out of Lescar and into the hills. It did involve lots of walking around farms and up and down hills which was beautiful. It was so lovely seeing the Pyrenees get closer with every step. 

While I have been hiking around cities during the holiday it is a very different experience walking the trail. Keeping the internal motivation to keep walking can be challenging but the amazing views make it worth while every time. 

I had a big steep slope right at the end of the walk to get to the top of the hill where the town was situated which felt a lot longer after walking for a few hours previous but was definitely a doable journey and gives me good hopes for the journey to come over the next few days. 

I checked into the Airbnb and the hosts were very kind. This is a very small town so there were no places for food but I had plenty to eat with me in my bag to rustle up enough snacks to keep me going till breakfast.
