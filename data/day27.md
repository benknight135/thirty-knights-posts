# Day 27: Bordeaux

### Wine museum

I had of course originally intended on arriving in Bordeaux the day previous and having a whole day in the city however due to the change of plans this became an afternoon. Though the whole point of the next few days still needs to be a chance for me to relax from the hiking. I chose to focus on the important thing that I knew I wanted from Bordeaux and that is of course, wine. The train journey from Bedous had me arriving in Bordeaux around lunch time at which point I headed to La Cite du Vin. This is the wine museum hosted in a magnificent building. It has exhibits over many floors that tell the history of wine, the craft of making wine, and the impact of environment on wine. Also there is a section on wine tasting which has many glass bell jars with the key scents that wine may include. There is a funnel next to each jar where you get a sample and an audio guide talks through how this is found in wine. Though the highlight of the experience is on the top floor where I was given a free glass of wine which is meant to be chosen based answering few questions on the type of wine I would like using the knowledge gained from the museum. And then I enjoyed the wine while looking out in a viewing platform over the city.
