### Vesuvius

I can’t quite believe it but I am writing this from the top of Vesuvius!

A bus takes people to the base through winding roads. Once at the base there is an approximately 30 minute steep walk to the top. Luckily all the way up there is immensely fantastic views all over Naples that keep you going. At the top there is a walk around the lip of the volcano where you are able to look down into the deep chasm left behind from eruption. There is also a cafe at the top that serves food and drinks so I had lovely cheese and ham sandwich as a reward for the climb whilst looking over stunning scenery.

On the way back down, the driver stops off at a little shop where a local farmer sells limoncello. This is of course a trap to get tourists to buy bottles but there are doing free tasting of all sorts of goodies such a lemon chocolate and a mix of limoncello with rum and mozzarella which tastes like baileys.

### Pompeii

Once back on the ground I headed for the ancient ruins of Pompeii. It is absolutely amazing to walk through the city with fascinating new things at every turn. My audio guide device didn’t work but it really didn’t matter as there were loads of tour guides explaining everything anyway. It felt a little weird in the areas where they have on display the people that were preserved in the ash. Knowing loads of tourists (including me) are crowding around the remains. They are so well preserved that it feels so much more intrusive. But anyway, one of the things that amazed me the most were the grand mosaics and wall paintings in the larger homes. They have huge intricate designs and in such lovely colours. I don’t think it would be possible to see everything but I did do my very best probably spending about 2-3 hours weaving through every nook and cranny.
