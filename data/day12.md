### Dug too deep

Today I woke up bright and early to hike Monte Ceceri, which is north east from the city of Florence. This is a well marked trail that makes its way up the mountain but starts with an additional hour walk to escape the city streets before the trail begins. Once on the mountain side the trail took me up through the woodlands on the side of Monte Ceceri which includes many amazing caves from quarrying to construct many of the buildings of Florence.

### To the top

At the half way point I reached a viewing platform that has picnic tables with beautiful views all across Florence. This was the perfect spot to eat the pancetta I had got from the same food cart yesterday and it also tasted just as glorious is the sandwich from the day before.

It is rumoured that this is the mountain where Leonardo da Vinci experimented with his flying machines and there is an engraved stone in his honour at the top.

### The way back down

The route back was a lot more challenging as it was off the main trail and required jumping over fallen tries and thin passages with steep drops. But was a clear marked trail and provided more beautiful views and real grounding in nature. On the way I also came across an old miners hut.

The final hour walk back through the city was a tough one as the motivation to keep going when surrounded by nature and beautiful views is certainly much easier than busy traffic and noisy streets. But eventually I made it back to the hostel and decided to have a quick shower and then a well needed nap.
